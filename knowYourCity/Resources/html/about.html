    <p>PDX Social History Guide is a free app and website featuring stories about people and places vital to the city of Portland's cultural heritage. Portland has been home to many ethnic groups and cultures &mdash; including Native American, African American, Chinese, Japanese, Greeks and Jews, among others.</p> <p>Because of urban development, some of these communities have little physical remnants of their neighborhoods. Consequently, many visiting Portland for the first time &mdash; and even those that have lived here many years &mdash; are unaware of the city's history.</p> <p>PDX Social History Guide brings these stories to the surface through interviews, mapping and smart phone technology, as well as a corresponding website.</p>
