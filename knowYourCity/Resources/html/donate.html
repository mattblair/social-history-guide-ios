<p>PDX Social History has been made possible only by the help and dedication of a team of volunteers. We would like to make this app accessible to all, but we need your support to keep this project open and free. Your support will enable us to only improve what weâ€™ve started, but also to expand this project and work on additional stories. Any amount, small or large, helps support our efforts. Donate either a one-time gift or recurring monthly installments using Network for Good, by clicking the image below.</p>
