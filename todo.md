## Bugs and Known Issues
* Test and improve map region calculation when in or near the covered data region (needs more field testing)
* Accessibility implementation is not consistent
* Custom subject line and message when sharing via email
* Normalize size/weight/alignment of icons (e.g. line weight on map and info icon in nav bar)
* Add build script to add/swap in files not included in the repo (KYCPrivateConstants.m, proprietary image files, CocoaPods, etc) so it builds after a fresh clone 
* Rename project and directory structure to reflect name change from KnowYourCity to SocialHistoryGuide

## Features
* Add nearby list to app
* Add GeoJSON parsing and annotation generation to story map (example: Golden West)
